      body: >
        The device request object was created with untouched fields left unset.
        When

        comparing state to determine if a transition is required this would

        result in a mismatch between:

            {
              Driver: '',
              Count: 1,
              DeviceIDs: null,
              Capabilities: [Array],
              Options: null
            }

        and

            {
              Count: 1,
              Capabilities: [Array],
            }

        Which in turn resulted in the target service being continously
        restarted.

        The fix is to instantiate the object in full.

        This reverts commit 153655b523af94d8192f0e0eb5574c67fbf85008.


        Dependabot does not allow to limit version updates to just patches or
        security

        updates. Adding this configuration results in excess noise from

        major and minor versions. We are reverting this change for the moment

        and look for another version managment tool.

      hash: 4cdf26f82fd25284f7a7496fc2d91232c64a3e2e
      body: >
        This PR adds the following


        * Supervisor v1 API application actions now return HTTP status code 423
        when locks
          are preventing the action to be performed. Previously this resulted in a
          503 error
        * Supervisor API v2 service actions now returns HTTP status code 423
        when locks are
          preventing the action to be performed. Previously, this resulted in an
          exception logged by the supervisor and the API query timing out
        * Supervisor API `/v2/applications/:appId/start-service` now does not
          check for a lock. Lock handling in v2 actions is now performed by each
          step executor
        * `/v1/apps/:appId/start` now queries the target state and uses that
          information to execute the start step (as v2 does). Previously start
          resulted in `cannot get appId from undefined`
        * Extra tests for API methods

    - subject: Ensure the first target state request is applied
      hash: e4e895630f53ce5f00ebc5c1486a90b0f9ca9998
      body: |
        During first time run of the supervisor, the target state is queried
        by `reportInitialEnv`. Since this happens early on the initialization
        process, this target state report is missed by any listeners and this
        can lead to the initial target state not beeing applied (see #1455).

        This PR ensures that target state is re-emitted if there were no
        listeners setup on call to update.

      body: |
        This paves the way for running multiple applications and storing
        information related to the application against the application itself. A
        couple of hacks have been added to v1 and v2 endpoints to maintain
        compatability but these should eventually be removed with the addition
        of a v3 api.

    - subject: Mount docker socket under `/host/run` for services
      hash: 01477e41b8d3b12aebd5460bec9ed1991fbbb270
      body: |
        Currently, when the label `io.balena.features.balena-socket` is set,
        the balena engine socket is mounted under `/run/balena-engine.sock`.

        This causes a problem when using systemd inside the container, since
        this service remounts `/run` and `/run/lock` as tmpfs, causing the
        socket to become unavailable.

        Making a mount of the socket into `/host/run` solves this issue. This is
        the same approach taken with DBUS.

      hash: 4795c336d055862706be42ebb544caef93d55e35
      body: |
        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure

        ```
        version: '2.1'
        services:
          app_1:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
          app_2:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
          app_3:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
        ```

        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database entries
        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine handles this
        particular case). This case is not handled by the removal process
        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

      hash: dd5f62227a0b0d2024db924e7028c9fec8b2b1d9
      body: >
        The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

        memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater than

        it is.


        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers -
        Cached`,

        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free` commands.

    - subject: Fix config checks for ConfigFS backend
      hash: a5f3002e708c949b6de3c8ba495b2a89c13214fc
      body: |
        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the supervisor currently
        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465

        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead to
        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no change was
        needed.

      hash: c08de8701e49f417d2fc5849d237b9ed69b438e2
      body: |
        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will
        now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific resources.
        In this iteration the default scope will be to the application that
        the service belongs to.

        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API when in
        managed mode.

                The change type is considered 'major' because, by default,
                errors are

                now thrown for relatively common occurrences such as
                authentication

                failures when pulling from private registries, and library users
                may

                have to adapt.

                        This is very similar to the cache class they use by
                        default, with the

                        difference that it has a limit and won't grow
                        indefinitely, causing

                        memory leaks on long running applications like
                        Jellyfish.

                        This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to
                        the bottom of it.

                        It will impact performance, but right now there are
                        things that should

                        be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for
                        security purposes.

                        Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

                Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it

      hash: ae646a07ec6a6c96f7cb91f1d37898a94dbab47a
      body: >
        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API
        introduced

        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.


        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of

        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.

        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:

        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go


        Background on the composefile implementation:

        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and
        is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.

        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in
        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just
        being explicit about it.

        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken
        sync-debug.js.

        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process
        with the supervisor on a device.

        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long
        with

        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation
        tools

        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and
        were

        only to enable livepush builds.

        We add an implicit .0 to the end of l4t versions which do not fulfill
        semver, which allows us to always match using comparison operators, such

    - subject: Add a noinit option to sync-debug
      hash: c47ef6d42abfe840cfa833a9f8f3789e142299e6
      body: |
        The noinit option will avoid doing a complete sync to the supervisor
        on startup. This is useful when there has only been code changes, and no
        modules etc have been added. It can be helpful when running on a network
        with no external internet access, as everything needed is already inside
        the container.

        To aid this we also move to yargs, rather than try to do all of the
        parsing ourselves.

    - subject: Hide init method in configJson
      hash: d9c669ebad7b115f018a922f6b329950fd86b6b1
      body: |
        ConfigJson users now don't need to worry about initialization.
        It's done lazily on the first public method call.

        Implementation is also rewritten to follow async/await pattern.

      hash: 8cece238a9a7d552d5366ffa4170ba8998bb8bbf
      body: |
        Before this change a mixed device fleet with a subset using l4t would
        not be able to have containers which only run on the l4t based boards.
        We add a mock l4t version so the contracts will always be denied on
        non-l4t boards, but the release itself won't fail to validate.

        These contracts can specify an OS version and supervisor version that
        they require. If any of the containers in a release have requirements
        that are not met, the release is rejected, and the previous release
        continues to run.

        This also required refactoring the request library to be generated with
        a promise, as we now no longer get the information synchronously.

        We also cache the release info, to avoid grabbing it again within the
        same runtime, which does not make sense.

      hash: 8b4c9837fa39bcb6642f7fd3208afa8d26b9af46
      body: >
        With this change, we define a custom error handler as express middleware

        which renders 503 error with JSON response that includes status and
        message

        fields.


        The handler also logs the error, so the stack can be inspected in
        supervisor

        logs. It's also a point where we can report the error to analytics
        services.


        This removes a bunch of error handlers written in every request handler

        function. Behaviour should remain unchanged except the fact that

        /healthy endpoint now returns 503 in case of failure instead of 500.

        otherwise do nothing else.

      body: |
        The `createFromPath` method takes 3 parameters, while in a previous
        version it was only 2 (the new format splits the old format's first
        parameter into two, and keeping the last), before the refactor in commit
        23e564389daaa29feb231d1b091e07df82a7a300 (supervisor v9.18.4)
        The backup restoration call has not been updated and thus calls that
        function the old (wrong) way, resulting in failed restore, and volume
        management errors on a device that attempted a restore.

      hash: c109a24874650f5f8d5a80fa11c8a62163e4d36b
      body: |
        That way that this is performed is by first adding a depends_on entry
        for the target service if it appears in a network mode. Then when we
        generate the docker container for this service, we use the containerId
        of the target container and replace the network_mode with
        `container:<id>`.

        When comparing state, we check that the containerId still points to the
        contianerId of the target container, and in this way we ensure that
        when a network mode target container changes, we change the dependent
        container too.

    - subject: Don't attempt to cleanup any target state referenced volumes
      hash: a796777967facb96ade32f5a06e256b3b92d1e4b
      body: |
        The code before this change could potentially remove a volume which
        should not be removed if a container was deleted before the call that
        references said volume.

        To avoid this, we additionally filter the list of volumes to cleanup by
        any that are referenced in the target state. This means that cleanup
        will never remove it, as long as it's still supposed to be there,
        regardless of if a container references it or not.

        fix: When reporting initial config, avoid creating a "VPN enabled"
        unnecessary override
      hash: 743c8406c973af7ef85ff31ea8bb0bc99d4592fb
      body: >
        Since we were comparing the VPN's value before adding the explicit
        "true", there were cases

        were the VPN is off, and therefore "value" didn't match the default, so
        the supervisor would

        create a device specific SUPERVISOR_VPN_CONTROL = true, which is
        unnecessary and causes issues if

        users don't expect this and move the device to an app that has VPN
        disabled. The correct behavior

        is to compare "varValue" and only create a device config var if this
        value differs from the default.


        (This was the behavior before the TS conversion in
        01ed7bb103b4df8fb0679cf858220db42d4a0b92 )

        Changes in the node engine related to streams would cause the gzip
        streams flush function to be called at the wrong times. The sinon fake
        timers were also interacting with this.

        We use setImmediate to call the flush function, and remove sinon timers
        for the logging tests.

      body: |
        When assigning multiple host ports to a single container port before
        this change, the supervisor would incorrectly take only the first host
        port into consideration. This change makes it so that every host port
        per container port is considered.

        configuration mismatch.

        the api to reject the update unecessarily.

        reporting logs from the container. If this is the first time we've seen
        a container, we get all logs, and for every log reported we save the
        timestamp. If it is not the first time we've seen a container, we
        request all logs since the last reported time, ensuring no interruption
        of service.

        Add a random jitter to target state polls, and a config var to ignore
        update notifications and not poll immediately after startup
      hash: 8f07bf62de4a509ac74380af8be42b2acf3c1b76
      body: >
        This commit does two related things:


        * We make the poll interval a random time between 0.5 and 1.5 times the
        configured interval.

        * We introduce the BALENA_SUPERVISOR_INSTANT_UPDATE_TRIGGER
        configuration variable, that defaults to true. If this variable is set

        to false, then calls to /v1/update are ignored, and on startup the
        supervisor waits for a poll interval before getting the target state.


        This will help especially on cases where there's a large number of
        devices on a single network. By disabling instant updates and setting a
        large

        poll interval, we can now achieve a sitation where not all devices apply
        an update at the same time, which can help avoid

        overwhelming the network.

      body: |
        When comparing a stopped container after a start request, the container
        ID will be present in the target state (where usually it is not). We
        were already filtering this value out of the current state, but
        neglected to do so for the target state. This change now ensures we
        remove it from both alias lists if it exists.

      body: >
        In an edge case observed in the field, a supervisor's database held two
        applications

        because the device had been moved and the update lock was set in the old
        app. This causes

        the updated supervisor to be unable to start, logging "No compatible
        releases found in API",

        because it can't fetch the release for the app it was moved from.


        This commit changes the migration code to iterate through all apps, and
        remove any for which

        we can't get a release.

        fix: When pinning a preloaded device, ensure the pinning is done when

        Without this patch, if for some reason device pinning fails (e.g.
        connectivity goes down) or anything

        interrupts the initialization after provisioning completes but before
        pinning is completed, after a retry

        the supervisor would just skip the pinning code, leaving the device
        unpinned. This patch ensures that the

        pinning procedure is run even if the device was already provisioned (as
        long as the pinning flag has been set,

        of course). This matches the behavior that the CoffeeScript code had
        from before the TypeScript conversion.

        We run the risk of the state engine exiting early when a dependency is
        not ready, especially in local mode. This changes forces a noop to be
        returned when we are waiting on another service, which is the process
        used elsewhere in the state engine.

        During the conversion to typescript, the VPN active check was being

      body: |
        In the case of an airgapped supervisor, with a target state that
        requests the vpn be enabled, the supervisor will constantly loop on
        trying to set the vpn to on. Unfortunately the vpn requires an internet
        connection to be configured, so it will never be turned on.

        We add the concept of no-ops to the device-config state change steps,
        and don't end the state engine transition while these are present
        (similar to how image pulls are implemented).

        existed in the database already, this would fail validation. We add a
        migration which will look explcitily for the failing value and switch it
        to the new default.

        code failures directly.

        We now use the coerced value as the actual value we will store, and more
        importantly emit. This means that the config.on('change' ...) calls will
        always be properly typed, which before this change was not a guarantee
        that we could make.

      hash: f3264862ca73e9b059da7fa7ce19aa67bfb9c296
      body: |
        Adjacent ports are always grouped together by docker when reporting the
        container state (from an inspect), so adjacent ports defined in the
        compose file would not match as they would not have been normalized.

        We make sure to always normalize the input port configuration, so that
        it will match the docker output (if it should).

        We also don't sort in the fromComposePorts function anymore as that is
        handled by the normalize function.

        In the original implementation it was possible that the delete did not
        wait for the kill step to be finished, so it would not be deleted.

        We seperate this process into two steps, to allow for the container to
        have stopped before proceeding.

        Docker always returns ports in ascending order, so if they aren't
        specified like that in the compose, a restart loop would occur. This
        patch changes the port maps to be stored in ascending order, based on
        an alphabetical sort of the internalStart port (not taking into account
        the protocol). This is the same as how Docker returns them, so they will
        match, regardless of input form.

        Fix a race condition that could cause an unnecessary restart of a
        service immediately after download
      hash: 42737cb9e96b889d0fdfd48926778a38566d927b
      body: >
        Up to now, there was a slim but non-zero chance that an image would be
        downloaded between the call to `@getTarget` inside deviceState

        (which gets the target state and creates Service objects using
        information from available images), and the call to

        `@images.getAvailable` in ApplicationManager (which is used to determine
        whether we should keep waiting for a download or start the

        service). If this race condition happened, then the ApplicationManager
        would infer that a service was ready to be started (because

        the image appears as available), but would have incomplete information
        about the service because the image wasn't available when

        the Service object was created. The result would be that the service
        would be started, and then immediately on the next applyTarget

        the ApplicationManager would try to kill it and restart it to update it
        with the complete information from the image.


        This patch changes this behavior by ensuring that all of the additional
        information about the current state, which includes available images,

        is gathered *before* building the current and target states that we
        compare. This means that if the image is downloaded after the call to
        getAvailable, the Service might be constructed with all the information
        about the image, but it won't be started until the next pass, because
        ApplicationManager will treat it as still downloading.

        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that
        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by
        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to
        provide nested-changelogs.
